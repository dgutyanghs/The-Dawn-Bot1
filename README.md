## ⚙️ Configuration

### settings.yaml

This file contains general settings for the bot:

```yaml
threads: 5 # Number of threads for simultaneous account operations
keepalive_interval: 120 # Delay between keepalive requests in seconds
referral_code: "YOUR_REFERRAL_CODE" # Referral code for registration
captcha_service: "2captcha" # Service for solving captcha (2captcha or anticaptcha)
two_captcha_api_key: "YOUR_2CAPTCHA_API_KEY"
anti_captcha_api_key: "YOUR_ANTICAPTCHA_API_KEY"

imap_settings: # IMAP settings for email providers
  gmail.com: imap.gmail.com
  outlook.com: imap-mail.outlook.com
  # Add more email providers as needed
```

### Other Configuration Files
In the path: ./[config]->[data], there are 3 files: farm.txt, register.txt, proxies.txt
#### 📁 register.txt
Contains accounts for registration.
```
Format:
email:password
email:password
...
```

#### 📁 farm.txt

```
Format:
email:password
email:password
...
```

#### 📁 proxies.txt

```
Format:

http://ip:port:user:pass

## 🚀 Usage

1. Ensure all configuration files are set up correctly.
2. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The recommended delay between keepalive requests is 120 seconds.
- If you have unverified accounts, you can use the `register` module again to reverify them.
- Captcha solving now uses external services (2captcha, anti-captcha) due to changes in captcha complexity.
- A database is used to optimize login processes by storing authorization tokens.
- For email services like Gmail, you may need to use application-specific passwords instead of regular email passwords.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Email Verification Issues**: Check your email provider's IMAP settings in `settings.yaml`.
- **Captcha Problems**: Verify your captcha service API key and account balance.
- **Proxy Issues**: Ensure your proxy format is correct and the proxies are functional.
